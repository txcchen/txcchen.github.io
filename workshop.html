            <h3>About This Project</h3>
            <p>This project is a web application developed with the MERN tech stack that allows users to manage various projects that involve multiple participants 
                and streamlines the check-in process via a project dashboard and custom submission form, titled [Workshop]. 
            </p>
            <p>I have completed a prototype of the application deployed with Render.com</p>
            <p><span class="desLabel isPink">Demo - Home Page</span><a href="https://workshop-ij3r.onrender.com">https://workshop-ij3r.onrender.com</a></p>

            <h6 class="desLabel isPink"> Designer & Developer</h6>
            
            <p> Workshop is intended for artists to more easily manage art projects as the project organizer or moderator.</p>
            <h6 class="desLabel isPink"> Inspiration & Problem Definition</h6>
            <p>I have participated in Secret Santa Art Exchanges as an artist and also as a moderator. 
             For these art exchanges, participating artists are required to submit progress checks on pre-determined deadline dates to ensure that they are working on their art piece.
            Moderators are required to check and make sure that each participant has submitted a progress check at those times.
            </p>
            <p>
            Previously, I was one of the moderators for my friend's Secret Santa Art Exchange. We kept track of the participants and progress checks with 
            Google Spreadsheets and had participants submit their work-in-progress (WIP) via a Google Form. We would then go through each form and check it off on the spreadsheet.
            At the time, I thought <span style="font-style: italic;">It would be convenient if the form directly linked to the spreadsheet so that the artist's WIP is automatically linked.</span>
            This would make it easier to manage the art exchange and also minimize human-error of possibly checking off the wrong person. 
            </p>
            <p>So this year, I decided to create a web application that will do just that - manage art projects. </p>

            <p>Keeping in tune with the holiday spirit, the application is named <span class="desLabel isPink">Workshop</span> inspired by Santa's Workshop. 
            Workshop can manage not only art exchanges (Secret Santas, Valentines Exchanges, etc), it can also be used for managing art zine projects 
            or any project that requires participants to submit WIPs and progress checks.</p>

            <div class = "align-center">
                <img src="workshop/homepage.gif" alt="homepage" style="width: 700px; height: 400px; object-fit: contain;">
                <p>Home page for not logged in users. Will be updated to contain more details and infographics.</p>
            </div>

            <h6 class="desLabel isPink">Features</h6>
            <p>Features of Workshop include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="desLabel isPink">Projects</span> : moderator can create, edit, delete projects - all projects are shown on the dashboard</li>
                <li><span class="desLabel isPink">Roles</span> : moderator can add and delete roles (e.g "artist", "writer", etc)</li>
                <li><span class="desLabel isPink">Timeline</span> : moderator can add deadlines/tasks</li>
                <li><span class="desLabel isPink">Participants</span> : moderator can add and delete participants and assign them a role </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Managing all parts of a project is done via the Dashboard or in the project page.</p>
            <h6 class="desLabel isPink">Submission Form</h6>
            <p>The submission form is for the moderator to share with the participants for the participants to fill out. Once submitted,
                the participant's progress will be updated in the project page. 
            </p>
            <p><span class="desLabel isPink">Demo - Submission Form</span><a href="https://workshop-ij3r.onrender.com/form/65fc5cd7b27e61474e7aca99">Spring Art Exchange 2024 Submission Page</a></p>
            <p>Feel free to submit your progress if you are artist1, artist2, or artist3 and return to the demo project page linked above to see updates. Note that updates may be slow due to Render's free tier.</p>
            <div class = "align-center">

            </div>

            <h6 class="desLabel isPink">User Login</h6>
            <p>I decided to use Google authentication to allow users to log in with their google accounts. This way, I only store the user's Google email and profile picture. </p>
           
            <h6 class="desLabel isPink">Database</h6>
            <p>I used MongoDB to store data. I have 3 models - User, Projects, and Participants. As shown in the gif below, 
                when the participant submits their progress via the form, the information will be updated in the participant document. 
                This is also how the Project is updated with tasks and roles.  </p>
            <div class = "align-center">
                <img src="workshop/database.gif" alt="database" style="width: 700px; height: 400px; object-fit: contain;">
            </div>

            <h6 class="desLabel isPink">Demo - Local</h6>
            <p>This is a video of Workshop hosted locally. In the demo, the user shows the home page for nonlogged in users, the project dashboard, creates a new project, edits the project, creates new roles, tasks, and adds participants to a project.
                The submission form is also shown to demonstrate how it updates participant progress.
            </p>

            </div>

            <h6 class="desLabel isPink">Reflection & Future</h6>
            <p>I learned how to develop a web application using MERN and managed to implement useful features.
                Next, I will be improving the application, with to-dos including redesigning the UI, restructuring the database so that Roles can be linked to the Tasks belonging to that role, 
                using ContextAPI to access user information instead of prop drilling and add features such as adding collaborators/other moderators and making the project page publicly viewable/sharable for projects that don't require the art pieces to be private before the deadline.
                My goal is to have Workshop be usable to manage art projects.
            </p>
